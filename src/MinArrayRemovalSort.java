    *   Find the range of shortest subarray which when removed will make the remaining elements in the array sorted?

        Ex:
        [1, 2, 3, 99, 4, 2, 3, 5]

        Ans: [3, 5] - { 99, 4, 2 } which when removed will make array { 1, 2, 3, 3, 5} which is sorted.

        ii) [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5]
        Ans: []

        iii) [5, 4, 3, 2 ,1]
        Ans: [0, 3]
        But, [1, 4] is also a valid answer.
